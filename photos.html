		<td colspan="2" bgcolor="#ececec" align="center"> <p> The goal for this project was to take pictures using various composition techniques and then edit them to improve lighting and other aspects. I took a total of eight pictures and then narrowed it down to the following four photographs which I then edited in Adobe Photoshop.

		<p>This picture was taken with the Cannon EOS REBEL T3i camera. The shutter speed was set to 1/250s and the ISO was set at 6400. Little light was let into the image so it is dark and has many shadows. However, when I went to adjust this Gus, the cat, moved so this was the best picture I got.<a/><p/>

		<p>I brought some more color into the photo to highlight the white spots in his fur. I also cropped the image to utilize the rule of thirds and draw more attention to Gus. By adjusting the lighting the whites in his fur and eyes make them more noticeable and vibrant. To do that I used the curves and levels tools in Photoshop to get rid of some of the shadows.<a/><p/>

		<p>I cropped the photo and adjusted some of the light using the curves tool in Photoshop to bring a little more highlights in.

		<p>This picture was taken with the Cannon EOS REBEL T3i camera. The shutter speed was set to 1/1600s and the ISO was set at 6400. It was a bright sunny morning so a lot of light was coming in through the window making some parts of his fur hard to see. Gus, the cat, is also slightly blurry.<a/><p/>

			<img src="gus_napping_edited.jpg">
		<p>I cropped the image to the proper size of 3x5 and to better utilize the rule of thirds. I also adjusted some of the light levels and curves to add more shadows and take away some highlights; to better show his fur so it wasnâ€™t as lost in the light rays. When cropping the photo I took away the bright white spot from the window so Gus was more of the focus.<a/><p/>
